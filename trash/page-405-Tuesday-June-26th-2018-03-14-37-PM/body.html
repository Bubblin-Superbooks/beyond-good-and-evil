<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, "Why have sympathetic actions been praised?" The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: "What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;" he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:&mdash;the noble man also helps the unfortunate, but not&mdash;or scarcely&mdash;out of pity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power.</p></div> </div>
