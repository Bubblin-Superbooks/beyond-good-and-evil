<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But she does not want truth&mdash;what does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign, more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth&mdash;her great art is falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it not true that on the whole "woman" has hitherto been most despised by woman herself, and not at all by us?&mdash;We men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us;</p></div> </div>
