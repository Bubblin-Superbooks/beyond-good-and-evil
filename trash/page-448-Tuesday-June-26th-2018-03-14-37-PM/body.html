<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about myself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily, always without delight in 'the subject,' ready to digress from 'myself,' and always without faith in the result, owing to an unconquerable distrust of the POSSIBILITY of self-knowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of 'direct knowledge' which theorists allow themselves:&mdash;this matter of fact is almost the most certain thing I know about myself. There must be a sort of repugnance in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myself.&mdash;Is there perhaps some enigma therein? Probably; but fortunately nothing for my own teeth.&mdash;Perhaps it betrays the species to which I belong?&mdash;but not to myself, as is sufficiently agreeable to me."</p></div> </div>
