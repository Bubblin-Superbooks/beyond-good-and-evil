<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as "worthy of the SWEAT of the noble"&mdash;but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! "To think" and to take a matter "seriously," "arduously"&mdash;that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been their "experience."&mdash;Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything "arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax&mdash;in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are then the same thing with them.</p></div> </div>
