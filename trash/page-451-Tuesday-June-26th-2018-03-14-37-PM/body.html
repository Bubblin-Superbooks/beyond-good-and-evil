<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>He praises me, THEREFORE he acknowledges me to be right"&mdash;this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life of us recluses, for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and friendship.</p><p>284. To live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond... To have, or not to have, one's emotions, one's For and Against, according to choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT oneself on them as upon horses, and often as upon asses:&mdash;for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as well as of their fire. To conserve one's three hundred foregrounds; also one's black spectacles: for there are circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our "motives." And to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice, politeness. And to remain master of one's four virtues, courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude.</p></div> </div>
