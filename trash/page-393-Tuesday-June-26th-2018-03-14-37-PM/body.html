<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried, that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when&mdash;anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politics&mdash;he began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.&mdash;That these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean&mdash;what I mean COUNTER TO the "last Wagner" and his Parsifal music:&mdash;</p></div> </div>
