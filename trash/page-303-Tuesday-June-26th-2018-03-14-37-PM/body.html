<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>we see how MAN dwarfs himself, how YOU dwarf him! and there are moments when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist it,&mdash;when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity. You want, if possible&mdash;and there is not a more foolish "if possible"&mdash;TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?&mdash;it really seems that WE would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been! Well-being, as you understand it&mdash;is certainly not a goal; it seems to us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible&mdash;and makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The discipline of suffering, of GREAT suffering&mdash;know ye not that it is only THIS discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto?</p></div> </div>
