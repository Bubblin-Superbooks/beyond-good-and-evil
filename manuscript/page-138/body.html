<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes&mdash;and indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure&mdash;an ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conception&mdash;that is to say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy, as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN, although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. Formerly, in effect, one believed in "the soul" as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, "I" is the condition, "think" is the predicate and is conditioned&mdash;to think is an activity for which one MUST suppose a subject as cause.</p></div> </div>
