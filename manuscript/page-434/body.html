<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner "desperateness" of higher men, this eternal "too late!" in every sense&mdash;may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction&mdash;of his "going to ruin" himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness&mdash;from what his "business"&mdash;has laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him.</p></div> </div>
