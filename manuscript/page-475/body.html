<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Midday of life! My second youth's delight! My summer's park! Unrestful joy to long, to lurk, to hark! I peer for friends!&mdash;am ready day and night, For my new friends. Come! Come! The time is right! 14. This song is done,&mdash;the sweet sad cry of rue Sang out its end; A wizard wrought it, he the timely friend, The midday-friend,&mdash;no, do not ask me who; At midday 'twas, when one became as two. 15. We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne, Our aims self-same: The Guest of Guests, friend Zarathustra, came! The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn, And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn.</p></div> </div>
