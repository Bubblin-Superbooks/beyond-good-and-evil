The actual "interests" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another direction&mdash;in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE IS,&mdash;that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other.</p></div> </div>
