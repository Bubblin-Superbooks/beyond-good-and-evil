<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>we MUST make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality. "Will" can naturally only operate on "will"&mdash;and not on "matter" (not on "nerves," for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever "effects" are recognized&mdash;and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will. Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of will&mdash;namely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition&mdash;it is one problem&mdash;</p></div> </div>
