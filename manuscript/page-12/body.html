<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SUPPOSING that Truth is a woman&mdash;what then? Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women&mdash;that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien&mdash;IF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground&mdash;nay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism;</p></div> </div>
