<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ye go! Thou didst endure enough, oh, heart;&mdash; Strong was thy hope; Unto new friends thy portals widely ope, Let old ones be. Bid memory depart! Wast thou young then, now&mdash;better young thou art! 10. What linked us once together, one hope's tie&mdash; (Who now doth con Those lines, now fading, Love once wrote thereon?)&mdash; Is like a parchment, which the hand is shy To touch&mdash;like crackling leaves, all seared, all dry. 11. Oh! Friends no more! They are&mdash;what name for those?&mdash; Friends' phantom-flight Knocking at my heart's window-pane at night, Gazing on me, that speaks "We were" and goes,&mdash; Oh, withered words, once fragrant as the rose! 12. Pinings of youth that might not understand! For which I pined, Which I deemed changed with me, kin of my kind: But they grew old, and thus were doomed and banned: None but new kith are native of my land! 13.</p></div> </div>
