<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nature is not different in that respect, nor better than we": a fine instance of secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic&mdash;likewise a second and more refined atheism&mdash;is once more disguised. "Ni dieu, ni maitre"&mdash;that, also, is what you want; and therefore "Cheers for natural law!"&mdash;is it not so? But, as has been said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along, who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the same "Nature," and with regard to the same phenomena, just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of power&mdash;an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all "Will to Power" before your eyes, that almost every word, and the word "tyranny" itself, would eventually seem unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor&mdash;</p></div> </div>
