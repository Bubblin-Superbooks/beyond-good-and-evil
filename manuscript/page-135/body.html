<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To have bound up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along with the Old Testament into one book, as the "Bible," as "The Book in Itself," is perhaps the greatest audacity and "sin against the Spirit" which literary Europe has upon its conscience.</p><p>53. Why Atheism nowadays? "The father" in God is thoroughly refuted; equally so "the judge," "the rewarder." Also his "free will": he does not hear&mdash;and even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he uncertain?&mdash;This is what I have made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of European theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth,&mdash;it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust.</p></div> </div>
