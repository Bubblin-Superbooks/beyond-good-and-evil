<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Bullock, M.A. (1903).] "the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva&mdash;is REALLY the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries."&mdash;The difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great&mdash;it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, ACTUALLY&mdash;played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality&mdash;who assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what? Is that really&mdash;a pessimist?</p></div> </div>
