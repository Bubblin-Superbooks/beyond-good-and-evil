<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>277. It is too bad! Always the old story! When a man has finished building his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares something which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before he&mdash;began to build. The eternal, fatal "Too late!" The melancholia of everything COMPLETED&mdash;!</p><p>278.&mdash;Wanderer, who art thou? I see thee follow thy path without scorn, without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a plummet which has returned to the light insatiated out of every depth&mdash;what did it seek down there?&mdash;with a bosom that never sighs, with lips that conceal their loathing, with a hand which only slowly grasps: who art thou? what hast thou done? Rest thee here: this place has hospitality for every one&mdash;refresh thyself! And whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases thee? What will serve to refresh thee? Only name it, whatever I have I offer thee!</p></div> </div>
