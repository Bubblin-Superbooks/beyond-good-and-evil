<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>1. MIDDAY of Life! Oh, season of delight! My summer's park! Uneaseful joy to look, to lurk, to hark&mdash; I peer for friends, am ready day and night,&mdash; Where linger ye, my friends? The time is right! 2. Is not the glacier's grey today for you Rose-garlanded? The brooklet seeks you, wind, cloud, with longing thread And thrust themselves yet higher to the blue, To spy for you from farthest eagle's view. 3. My table was spread out for you on high&mdash; Who dwelleth so Star-near, so near the grisly pit below?&mdash; My realm&mdash;what realm hath wider boundary? My honey&mdash;who hath sipped its fragrancy? 4. Friends, ye are there! Woe me,&mdash;yet I am not He whom ye seek? Ye stare and stop&mdash;better your wrath could speak! I am not I? Hand, gait, face, changed? And what I am, to you my friends, now am I not? 5.</p></div> </div>
