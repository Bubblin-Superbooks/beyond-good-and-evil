<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions&mdash;to give a general appreciation of them&mdash;are among the principal causes which have kept the type of "man" upon a lower level&mdash;they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED.</p></div> </div>
