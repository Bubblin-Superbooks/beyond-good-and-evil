Should one wish love or hatred from him&mdash;I mean love and hatred as God, woman, and animal understand them&mdash;he will do what he can, and furnish what he can. But one must not be surprised if it should not be much&mdash;if he should show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality is he still "nature" and "natural." His mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy.</p></div> </div>
