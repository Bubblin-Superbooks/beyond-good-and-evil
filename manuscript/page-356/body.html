<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets "done" with them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating "digestion." And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so the German loves "frankness" and "honesty"; it is so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!&mdash;This confidingness, this complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can "still achieve much"! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty German eyes&mdash;and other countries immediately confound him with his dressing-gown!&mdash;I meant to say that, let "German depth" be what it will&mdash;among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at it&mdash;</p></div> </div>
