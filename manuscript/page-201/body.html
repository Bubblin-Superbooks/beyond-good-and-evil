<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make him&mdash;good."&mdash;This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that "it is STUPID to do wrong"; while they accept "good" as identical with "useful and pleasant," without further thought. As regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.&mdash;Plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them&mdash;he, the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications&mdash;namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities.</p></div> </div>
