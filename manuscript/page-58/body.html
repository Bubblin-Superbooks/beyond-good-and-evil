<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command&mdash;consequently obedience, and therefore action&mdash;was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. "Freedom of Will"&mdash;that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order&mdash;who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them.</p></div> </div>
