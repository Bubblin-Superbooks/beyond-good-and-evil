And to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE&mdash;nowadays?</p><p>213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: one must "know" it by experience&mdash;or one should have the pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:&mdash;the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them.</p></div> </div>
