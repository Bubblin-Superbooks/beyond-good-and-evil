<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&mdash;Is this our mode?&mdash;From German heart came this vexed ululating? From German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly hand-dilation, This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this faltering, falling, shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling? This sly nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured heaven-o'erspringing?&mdash;Is this our mode?&mdash;Think well!&mdash;ye still wait for admission&mdash;For what ye hear is ROME&mdash;ROME'S FAITH BY INTUITION!</p></div> </div>
