<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On an average it DOES NOT happen; and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who hardly know to what extent they are waiting, and still less that they wait in vain. Occasionally, too, the waking call comes too late&mdash;the chance which gives "permission" to take action&mdash;when their best youth, and strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how many a one, just as he "sprang up," has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! "It is too late," he has said to himself&mdash;and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for ever useless.&mdash;In the domain of genius, may not the "Raphael without hands" (taking the expression in its widest sense) perhaps not be the exception, but the rule?&mdash;</p></div> </div>
